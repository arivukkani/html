    <p class="nation" id="x">The death toll in the car explosion near New Delhi’s Red Fort stands at 13, and the investigation
        has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Initial investigation, as of Tuesday (November
        11, 2025), seems to suggest a doctor from Pulwama was likely the sole occupant of the vehicle that exploded on
        Monday (November 10). The bomb was “premature” as the person was said to be acting in haste due to pressure of
        police raids that had already led to the arrest of two colleagues.
